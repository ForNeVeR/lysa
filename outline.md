# Outline

Here's my (pharpend) basic outline for the book. It's extremely rough at this
point and will probably be gutted and slaughtered in its entirety.

* Chapter 1, Introduction
    + Motivation
    + Introduction of the primary authors (Peter Harpending, Randy Brown).
    + Book license
    + How to contribute 
    + Potential scope of the book
    + What background knowledge you need.
        - ideally this would just be fluency in english, and elementary school math.
    + What is math?
    + Why are we interested in it?

All of the chapters beyond this point will be assumed to have a multitude of
exercises, graphs, examples, applications, etc.

* Chapter 2, Groups, Rings, and Fields
    + Introduction to Groups, Rings, and Fields
    + $\mathbb{N}$ is a group, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a ring, $\mathbb{R}$ is a
      field.
    + How this applies to everyday life (Boring!)

* Chapter 3, Proofs
    + What are proofs?
    + Proof-based approach to groups, rings, fields.

* Chapter 4, Functions
    + What are functions?
    + Some examples

* Chapter 5, Algorithms
    + What are algorithms?
    + Examples

* Chapter 6, monomials
    + Examples
    + How to manipulate them algebraically
    + Graphs of lines

* Chapter 7, polynomials
    + Examples
    + How to manipulate them algebraically
    + Graphs of lines
    + Quadratic formula
    + Proof that there is no quintic formula?

* Chapter 8, exponential functions
* Chapter 9, logarithms
* Chapter 10, trig functions

This is a good segue to talk about Complex numbers

* Chapter 11, complex and imaginary numbers
* Chapter 12, Complex functions
* Chapter 13, Complex algorithms

Good segue to talk about the concept of dimensions

* Chapter 14, Dimensions
* Chapter 15, Parametric functions
* Chapter 16, Complex parametric functions
* Chapter 17, functions that go from F^n to F, where F is a field.
* Chapter 18, functions that go from F to F^n, where F is a field.
* Chapter 19, functions that go from F^n to F^m, where F is a field.
                                                         
We'll next want to approach *systems* of equations. first\ matrices

* Chapter 20, Matrices
    + Matrix addition, multiplication, etc
    + Matrices as linear functions

* Chapter 21, Systems of equations
    + What is a system of equations
    + using matrices to solve for them

* Chapter 22, Vector spaces

... Basically go through linear algebra

* Chapter 35, calculus

... Go through calculus and differential equations
