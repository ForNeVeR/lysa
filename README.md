# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach
to math.

You can see the preliminary project page at https://learnmath.github.io/lysa/
. We haven't actually written any content yet, so don't get your hopes up. You
are welcome to add content, but please see the
[contributing guide][contrib-guide] first. 

If you like chatting on IRC, come see us in `#learnmath` on FreeNode. If you
don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a client set up, you can connect
through [FreeNode's webchat][webchat].

We hope you have a wonderful time reading the book! (Assuming we eventually get
around to writing it =P).

You can email me (pharpend) at `pharpend2@gmail.com`. I don't check that email
very often, so IRC is better. I'm `pharpend` in the channel.

If you notice any errors, don't be shy to report then in the
[issue tracker](//github.com/pharpend/lysa/issues). If you have any suggestions
for improving LYSA, also post them in the issue tracker (or bring them up in the
IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel,
or in the issue tracker.
