# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach
to math.

The title (and content) is inspired by Miran Lipovaƒça's
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) If you want
to learn the Haskell programming language, we recommend that book.

I have observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to take
an approach wherein it's more important to keep an academic tone than it
is for the reader to enjoy reading the book, and to understand the
material. We take the opposite approach. We want to create a book that
is fun to read, easy to understand, while still addressing the more
advanced concepts in math.
