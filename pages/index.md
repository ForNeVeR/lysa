# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach
to math.

The title (and content) is inspired by Miran Lipovača's
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!][lyah] If you want to learn the Haskell
programming language, we recommend that book.

I have observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to take an
approach wherein it's more important to keep an academic tone than it is for the
reader to understand the material, and, more importantly, enjoy reading the
book. We take the opposite approach. We want to create a book that is fun to
read, easy to understand, while still addressing the more advanced concepts in
math.

If you like chatting on IRC, come see us in `#learnmath` on FreeNode. If you
don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a client set up, you can connect
through [FreeNode's webchat][webchat]. You can email me (pharpend) at
`pharpend2@gmail.com`. I don't check that email very often, so IRC is
better. I'm `pharpend` in the channel.

You are more than welcome to contribute, but please read the
[contributing guide][contrib-guide] first. (Sorry, we know how annoying those
are.)

If you notice any errors, don't be shy to report then in the
[issue tracker][issues]. If you have any suggestions for improving LYSA, also
post them in the issue tracker (or bring them up in the IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel,
or in the issue tracker.

### Excerpt

If you want an idea of what the book might look like, here's an excerpt from the
previous attempt.

> Introduction
> ============
> 
> This book is about Commutative Algebra - a fun area of math. That
> statement is a bit redundant - is there an area of math that isn’t fun?
> Of course not! Now let’s get started!
> 
> > Everything is a toy if you play with it.
> >
> > – Chris Pratt, Parks and Recreation
> 
> So what is Commutative Algebra?
> -------------------------------
> 
> Simply put, Commutative Algebra is the study of things called
> i<span>commutative rings</span>. There are two words there,
> “commutative,” and “ring.” Before we can get to those words, you have to
> understand some other words first.
> 
> ### Sets and elements
> 
> Imagine a bunch of things. These things all have some property in
> common. Congratulations! You just intuited a i<span>set</span>! See,
> you’re getting this!
> 
> For example, look at i<span>integers</span>. You may have heard of
> “whole numbers,” numbers that don’t have a decimal point. Whole numbers
> are $\{0, 1, 2, 3,
> \ldots\}$. Integers are the same, but they include negative numbers. The
> integers are $\{\ldots, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$
> 
> #### Notation
> 
> Did you see that I cleverly tricked you into understanding some notation
> there? I’m also guessing you understood it! The notation I used is the
> brace notation for sets, as well as set extrapolation. Those words are a
> bit confusing.
> 
> The “brace notation” simply means I use curly braces (these things -
> $\{$ and $\}$) to express a set. Everything between those two braces is
> in the set. I also used commas to differentiate between the various
> things in the set. See, this math stuff isn’t hard!
> 
> I also used this thing called “assumed extrapolation.” That was what you
> did when you saw the ellipsis (the three dots - “$\ldots$”). See, you’re
> getting this stuff without even thinking about it! The ellipsis
> basically means “I think you’re smart enough to figure out what I’m
> going to put here.” And you are! Just look at how far you’ve gotten all
> on your own!
> 
> My Calculus teacher in high school was rather emphatic that mathematical
> notation is all about being lazy. That idea stuck with me. I think you’ll learn
> very quickly is that mathematicians are lazy. Really lazy.  We are so lazy that
> we can’t even bear to type the word “integer.” So, instead, we use letters to
> express these words. We use a large fancy Z, instead of writing “integers.” We
> really are that pretentious. So, whenever you see ${\mathbb{Z}}$, you can think
> “oh, he’s just a lazy jerk who can’t be bothered to type the word ‘integers’.”
> And you’ll probably be right.
