\ch{Introduction}

Before I bore you with a bunch of crap you don't care about, let's do some math,
shall we?

There are basically three notions you need to be familiar with in order to do
anything interesting in math. Those three things are {\it sets}, {\it
  functions}, and {\it proofs}. Unfortunately, to be familiar with one, you have
to be familiar with the other two.\footnote{You'll learn as we go along, when
  math people use a common term like {\it set}, {\it function}, {\it proof},
  {\it group}, {\it continuous} or {\it closed}, they usually mean something
  similar in concept to the colloquial term, but there are some strings
  attached. This is usually the case in the sciences too (e.g. \i{theory},
  \i{hypothesis}, \i{experiment}).}

So, what are each of those things?

\begin{itemize}
\item A \i{set} is an unordered collection of things. There is also no
  repetition. For instance, $\{2, 5\}$ is the same as $\{5, 2\}$ (because order
  doesn't matter). $\{2, 5, 5\}$ would be an invalid set, because there is
  repetition.

\item A \i{function} is a mathematical construct (well, obviously, else I
  wouldn't be talking about it). Basically, it takes some input, does something
  to it, and spits out some output. If you give the function the same input a
  bunch of times, you should get the same result each time. This concept is
  called ``referential transparency.'' If the function is not referentially
  transparent, then it's not a function. It's something else.

\item A \i{proof} is basically where you take a bunch of simple facts, called
  \i{axioms}, and chain them together to make \i{theorem}s. It's sort of like
  sticking puzzle pieces together to form a picture.

  The puzzle pieces (in this case, the axioms) aren't usually very interesting
  on their own. However, the picture they form (in this case, the theorem) can
  be really cool and enlightening. The proof would be analogous to an explicit
  set of instructions explaining how to put the pieces together.
\end{itemize}

Once you are familiar with each of those concepts, we can do all sorts of cool
stuff.  Throughout the book, we will prove all of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item If you tap your finger against a bridge at exactly the right frequency,
  the bridge will collapse. (Resonance)
\item The formula used to calculate the interest rate on your mortgage is
  actually just a fancy form of the ratios of angles in a triangle. (Euler's
  formula)
\item Logic can't be used to prove everything we know to be true. (Gödel's
  incompleteness theorem)
\end{itemize}

\s{Introduction (for real this time)}

This is a math book. Well, duh. Why did I write it?

Most math (and science) books nowadays seem to value keeping an academic tone
over ensuring that the reader understands the material, and --- more importantly
--- enjoys reading the book.

I take the opposite approach. I want to create a book that is fun to read and
easy to understand, while eschewing the practice of making myself look good.

The inspiration for this book is \href{http://learnyouahaskell.com/}{{\it Learn
    You a Haskell for Great Good!}, by Miran Lipovača}. Haskell is a programming
language, and LYAH is a great book for learning Haskell. If you are interested
in a print copy of LYAH, see \cite{lyah}.

\s{The community}

Despite the fact that I used ``I'' in the first part of the book, LYSA is
actually a community project, and many people participate in the writing of this
book.

If you want to talk to us, or to other math people, come see us in {\tt \#lysa}
on Freenode. If you don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a client set up,
you can connect through
\link{http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lysa}{Freenode's webchat}.

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the IRC
channel ({\tt \#lysa} on FreeNode in case you forgot).

If you want to submit a correction, or have some issue, or want to add some
content, really anything having to do with the content of the book, you can
visit our Gitorious page at \url{https://gitorious.org/lysa/lysa}.

\s{Licensing}

This book is ``open source'', which basically means that you have a lot more
freedom than you do with most books. You can copy this book and give it to your
friend. You can even print it out and sell it to your friends.\footnote{There
  are some restrictions though, see \cref{gfdl}.}

If, for instance, you are a schoolteacher and want to use this for your class,
you are free to edit it to your liking and give the modified copy to your
students.

LYSA is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License. \Cref{gfdl} contains
the license. Please read the license; it's actually pretty comprehensible.
