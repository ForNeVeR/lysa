\ch{Introduction}

In this book, we aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach to
mathematics.  We observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to
value keeping an academic tone over ensuring that the reader understands the
material, and --- more importantly --- enjoys reading the book. We take the
opposite approach. We want to create a book that is fun to read and easy to
understand, while still addressing the more advanced concepts in math.

We start with basic algebra, but teach it in the way most mathematicians
understand it. We then move on to the more advanced topics, like linear algebra,
calculus, and statistics.  In theory, you shouldn't need to know anything more
than basic arithmetic to understand this book. Nevertheless, if anything seems
too difficult, please let us know so that we can fix it!

% Someone write this in a less condescending tone.
% 
% We really like math, and we think it's not as difficult as people think it is,
% especially if you approach it in the way mathematicians do. So, we're going to
% approach all of math the way a mathematician would, but we won't use the overly
% formal tone a mathematician would.

% below: misfiled info that needs to be relocated

% We start with what are called the Peano Axioms, which will give you a good
% introduction to the utter pretentiousness found in your average field of math.
% In all seriousness, most people think that math is all about pumping out
% formulas and crunching numbers. That's about as far from the truth as you can
% get. Math is about qualitatively and precisely analyzing things and understanding
% the very nature of reality. The whole numbers thing is just a side gig, as you
% will see.
% 
% The Peano axioms are a very mathematical way of understanding basic arithmetic
% (addition, subtraction, division, etc). ``A mathematical way of understanding
% arithmetic'' may sound weird and even redundant, but you'll see. If you are
% dying to see what we're talking about, you can go ahead and skip to \cref{ch:
% Peano Axioms}.

\ss{Contributing to this Book}

This book is open-source. You can go to
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa}{our GitHub page} and see for yourself.
Part of being open-source means you can freely distribute the book, sell it, or
even change it. There are some restrictions, though (see \cref{ss: Licensing} for
details).

Most of them are fairly minor; if, for instance, you are a schoolteacher and
want to use this for your class, you are free to edit it to your liking and
give the modified copy to your students. The only real caveat is that you must
publish your source so others can use it. This may be a problem if you want to
do something such as include more exercises without publishing solutions. If
that is the case, open an issue on the
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/issues}{issue tracker} and we'll talk
about granting you an exception to the license.

You are more than welcome to contribute, but please read the
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/blob/master/contributing.md}{contributing guide}
first. (Sorry, we know how annoying those are.)

If you notice any errors, don't be shy! Report them in the
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/issues}{issue tracker}. If you have any
suggestions for improving LYSA, post them in the issue tracker too (or bring
them up in the IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel.

\s{How to read this book (and how to learn math)}

Now that that's all out of the way, let's talk a little about math. When this
chapter is over, we're going to dive right in to proving a bunch of things you
already know to be true. We feel that without a little explanation, these
proofs may leave you a little lost or confused. We'll save the explanation of
the proofs for later, but right now, we're going to talk about how to actually
learn math, and the proofs are a great example.

Most people's experience with math is through their primary and possibly
secondary education, which is or was a dreary affair in general, and math
probably even moreso, unless you're one of the lucky few. By lucky few, we
don't mean those wizards with a sort of inherent ability to do math--the first
thing you need to know about learning math is that math is for everyone with a
brain--that's you, right? You see, your brain is a pattern recognition engine,
and that's all math is: the study of patterns. Unlike reading or history, your
body comes with a biological imperative to know math. There's some really great
brain studies on the topic, but that's boring, and I said we're already done
with the boring part, so let's move on.

In that last paragraph, we presented what we hold to be the proper answer to
'what is math': the study of patterns. This is completely different from most
people's interaction with math: in primary school, we are taught how to apply
four operations to solve math problems. You're given something about two trains
leaving a station and going different speeds and different directions and yadda
yadda yadda and before you know it your teacher turned everything into a math
problem and it all seemed so forced--a layer on top of what was intuitive, and
made everything complicated. We agree--this is a counterintuitive approach to
math, and it makes math very confusing and disconnected. Math is just the study
of patterns. That is, math is not so much a way to solve a set of problems that 
exist in a sphere apart from what is natural, but a way to understand what's 
going on in the world around us. When you learn math, you should think of it as 
a science--another level of detail in the amazing world we live in.

That's how this book is written. It's written to reflect that math is a single 
unified study. While you're reading it, try to think of how what you're learning
clarifies or refines early material. This is a big deal to us, because one thing
we dislike most about the standard way of learning math is that at some point in 
everyone's math career, they learn they were taught something that wasn't actually
true. We want to avoid that.
