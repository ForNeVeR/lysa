\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach
to math.  The title (and content) is inspired by Miran Lipovaƒça's
\href{http://learnyouahaskell.com/}{Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!}  If you
want to learn the Haskell programming language, we recommend that book.

\section{Motivation}

I observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to take an approach
wherein it's more important to keep an academic tone than it is for the reader
to understand the material, and, more importantly, enjoy reading the book. We
take the opposite approach. We want to create a book that is fun to read, easy
to understand, while still addressing the more advanced concepts in math.

We start with what are called the Peano Axioms, which will give you a good
introduction to the utter pretentiousness found in your average
mathematician. In all seriousness, most people think that math is all about
pumping out formulas and crunching numbers. That's not what math is about. Math
is about qualitatively and precisely analyzing things, and to understand the
very nature of reality. The whole numbers thing is just a side gig, as you will
see.

The Peano axioms are a very mathematical way of understanding basic arithmetic
(addition, subtraction, division, etc). I know ``a mathematical way of
understanding arithmetic'' sounds weird, and even redundant, but you'll see. If
you are dying to see what I am talking about, you can go ahead and skip to
\cref{ch:peano-axioms}.

\section{Boring stuff}

This section is for people who want to get involved in our community. (Bleh,
right?)

If you like chatting on IRC, come see us in {\tt \#learnmath} on FreeNode. If
you don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a client set up, you can connect

\subsection{Contributing to this Book}

This book is open-source. You can go to
\href{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa}{our GitHub page} and see the source
code for this book. Part of being open-source means you can freely distribute
the book, sell it, or even change it. There are some caveats, though (see
\cref{licensing} for details).

Nonetheless, if, for instance, you are a schoolteacher and want to use this for
your students, but it's not quite right, you are free to edit it to your liking,
and then use your modified copy for your students. The only real caveat is, you
must publish your source so others can use it. This may be a problem if, for
instance, you want to include more exercises, but don't want to publish
solutions. If that is the case, open an issue on the
\href{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/issues}{issue tracker}, and we'll talk
about granting you an exception to the license.

You are more than welcome to contribute, but please read the
\href{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/blob/master/contributing.md}{contributing guide}
first. (Sorry, we know how annoying those are.)

If you notice any errors, don't be shy to report then in the
\href{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/issues}{issue tracker}. If you have any
suggestions for improving LYSA, also post them in the issue tracker (or bring
them up in the IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel,
or in the issue tracker.

\subsection{Licensing}\label{licensing}

LYSA is licensed under the
\href{http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/}{Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License}. This means many things, but
here's the gist of it:

\begin{itemize}
\item You are free to read this book, redistribute it, change it, sell it,
  what-have-you. There are a minimum of strings attached.
\item The first string - you have to give us credit. You can't claim that you
  wrote this book all on your own.
\item The second thing - you are welcome to make changes, but, if you publish
  your changes, you must publish your changes under the same license. This
  ensures that we can then integrate your changes back into the main work.
\end{itemize}
