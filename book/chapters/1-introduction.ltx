\ch{Introduction}

This book aims to take a logically rigorous yet informal approach to the basics
of higher math. In theory, you shouldn't need to know anything more than basic
arithmetic to understand this book. However, most of the authors have been
doing this for a while, so we might forget how hard it is at first. If anything
seems too difficult, please let us know so that we can fix it!

\s{Motivation}

We observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to value keeping
an academic tone over ensuring that the reader understands the material, and,
more importantly, enjoys reading the book. We take the opposite approach. We
want to create a book that is fun to read and easy to understand while still
addressing the more advanced concepts in math.

% something here about how we love math and
% want to make it more accessible, maybe?

% below: misfiled info that needs to be relocated

% We start with what are called the Peano Axioms, which will give you a good
% introduction to the utter pretentiousness found in your average field of math.
% In all seriousness, most people think that math is all about pumping out
% formulas and crunching numbers. That's about as far from the truth as you can
% get. Math is about qualitatively and precisely analyzing things and understanding
% the very nature of reality. The whole numbers thing is just a side gig, as you
% will see.
% 
% The Peano axioms are a very mathematical way of understanding basic arithmetic
% (addition, subtraction, division, etc). ``A mathematical way of understanding
% arithmetic'' may sound weird and even redundant, but you'll see. If you are
% dying to see what we're talking about, you can go ahead and skip to \cref{ch:
% Peano Axioms}.

\ss{Contributing to this Book}

This book is open-source. You can go to
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa}{our GitHub page} and see for yourself.
Part of being open-source means you can freely distribute the book, sell it, or
even change it. There are some restrictions, though (see \cref{ss: Licensing} for
details).

Most of them are fairly minor; if, for instance, you are a schoolteacher and
want to use this for your class, you are free to edit it to your liking and
give the modified copy to your students. The only real caveat is that you must
publish your source so others can use it. This may be a problem if you want to
do something such as include more exercises without publishing solutions. If
that is the case, open an issue on the
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/issues}{issue tracker} and we'll talk
about granting you an exception to the license.

You are more than welcome to contribute, but please read the
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/blob/master/contributing.md}{contributing guide}
first. (Sorry, we know how annoying those are.)

If you notice any errors, don't be shy! Report them in the
\link{https://github.com/learnmath/lysa/issues}{issue tracker}. If you have any
suggestions for improving LYSA, post them in the issue tracker too (or bring
them up in the IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel.
