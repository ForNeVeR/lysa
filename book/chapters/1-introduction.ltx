\chapter{Introduction}

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach
to math.

The title (and content) is inspired by Miran Lipovaƒça's
\href{http://learnyouahaskell.com/}{Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!}  If you
want to learn the Haskell programming language, we recommend that book.

I have observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to take an
approach wherein it's more important to keep an academic tone than it is for the
reader to understand the material, and, more importantly, enjoy reading the
book. We take the opposite approach. We want to create a book that is fun to
read, easy to understand, while still addressing the more advanced concepts in
math.

suggestions for improving LYSA, also post them in the issue tracker (or bring
them up in the IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel,
