\ch{Sets and Functions}

We'd like to start this book off finding some patterns.  In order to do that,
though, we need to introduce some objects for use to find patterns {\it in}.
These should be simple enough that we can grasp them intuitively, but not so
simple that all the patterns we find are trivial.  We would also like to
introduce something that will make future patterns easier to talk about.

The first kind of objects we will be looking at are {\it sets}.  Sets were first
studied by Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, in the second half of the
nineteenth century.  In mathematics, a set is a collection of objects with no
order and no duplicate elements.  Effectively, given a set $S$ and some other
object $x$, the only thing we can ask is ``does $S$ contain $x$?''  We write $x
\in S$ if the answer is `yes', and $x \not \in S$ if the answer is `no.'  If $x
\in S$, we say that "$x$ is an element of $S$", or simply "$x$ is in $S$".

There are several ways of writing down sets.  If we already have some objects,
we can make a set that contains all of them.  For example, if we assume that the
numbers 3 and 5 are well-defined (trust us here!), we can make the set $\{3,
5\}$.  In particular, if we take no objects, we can create the set that doesn't
contain anything.  This is called the empty set, and is usually denoted
$\emptyset$.  Note that even if we didn't have anything before, we do have an
object now, namely the empty set we just made.  That means we can construct a
set $\{\emptyset\}$ which contains the empty set and nothing else.  That's not
the same thing as the empty set (because the empty set doesn't contain
anything), so now we have two objects, and we can repeat this process.

There are four important sets of numbers that we will for now assume the
existence of.  First of all, there are the integers: these are just the whole
numbers, like $-1, 0, 1, 2$.  Traditionally, this set is denoted $\mathbb{Z}$.
The natural numbers, denoted $\mathbb{N}$, are all non-negative
integers\footnote{Conventions differ as to what the natural numbers are.
Everyone agrees that positive whole numbers (1, 2, 3\ldots) are natural.  Some
people say $0$ is also a natural numbers, while others disagree.  In this book,
0 {\it is} a natural number, so the natural numbers are 0, 1, 2, and so on.}.
The set of rational numbers, denoted $\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of all numbers that
can be written as a quotient (or fraction) $\frac{p}{q}$ of integers.  Finally,
the real numbers, denoted $\mathbb{R}$, contain everything on the number line.
Equivalently, a real number is just any number you can write down by writing
down an integer, and then writing any sequence of digits after the decimal
point, even an infinite sequence.

Sets certainly look simple enough to understand intuitively, but are they also
interesting enough to be worth studying?  The answer to that is a resounding
`yes.'  Back in his own day, the patterns Cantor found by studying set theory
were considered so thoroughly bizarre that many of his colleagues simply refused
to believe that Cantor could be right.  In the end, Cantor turned out to be
right all along, and his ideas can be found in any introductory text on
mathematics---including this one.

To give you a taste of the results, let's take a look at some of them.
Intuitively, sets can be of different sizes: it's clear that the empty set is
the smallest possible set, and that $\{2, 4\}$ is smaller than $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
When we get to infinite sets, however, the intuition fails.  Cantor formalised
this intuition, and the formal version also worked for infinite sets.  However,
the resulting inequalities he got were very surprising: for example, he found
that there are as many natural numbers as rational numbers, but that there are
strictly more real numbers.  Even worse, he proved that given any set, there is
always a set larger than it.  If you've ever heard of people talking about
``different kinds of infinity'', this is probably what they meant.

Sets alone, however, are not enough to derive Cantor's results.  If we only have
sets, given sets $X$ and $Y$, we can't say much about how $X$ and $Y$ relate to
each other.  To fix this, we'll introduce a second kind of object: functions.

A function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ specifies for every element of $X$ a
corresponding element of $Y$.  In other words, if $f$ is a function from $X$ to
$Y$ (denoted $f : X \to Y$) and $x \in X$, then $f(x) \in Y$.  A lot of high
school mathematics is about functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, even if
they are never presented that way.  For example, solving linear equations is
actually a question about functions:  ``given a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$ defined by

\[
  f(x) = 5x - 10
\]

find all $r \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(r) = 0$.''

It turns out that by taking sets $X$ and $Y$ and asking what kind of functions
exist between them, we can find out a lot about $X$ and $Y$ themselves.  We'll
continue this line of thought after some exercises.

\sss{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose $x$ is some object and $S$ is a set.  Does it make sense to ask
    ``How many times does $S$ contain $x$?''
  \item Earlier, we constructed the set $\{3, 5\}$.  We can also construct the
    set $\{5, 3\}$.  Are these the same set?
  \item Are the following true or false?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\emptyset \in \emptyset$
      \item $\emptyset \in \{\emptyset\}$
      \item $\emptyset = \{\emptyset\}$
      \item $\{\emptyset\} \in \{\emptyset\}$
    \end{itemize}
  \item We can construct the set $\{0, 1\}$.  What functions can you find from
    $\{0, 1\}$ to $\{0, 1\}$?  How many such functions are there?
  \item Can you find a function from $\emptyset$ to $\{0, 1\}$?  What about in
    the other direction?
  \item Suppose $X$ is a set.  Prove that there exists at least one function
    from $X$ to $X$.  How can this function be defined?  Why does this work if
    $X$ is the empty set?
  \item Suppose $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are sets, and you are given functions $f : X
  \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$.  Can you make a function from $X$ to $Z$?  How?
  \item Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are sets, $f : X \to Y$, and $x, y \in X$.  Do you
    think $x = y$ implies $f(x) = f(y)$?  Why, or why not?

\s{Injective Functions}

In the exercises, you saw that if $f : X \to Y$ and you had $x, y \in X$ such
that $x = y$, then necessarily $f(x) = f(y)$.  A function $f$ is said to be
injective if the converse is also true: if $x, y \in X$ and $x \neq y$, then
$f(x) \neq f(y)$.

Let's consider some examples.  Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ be defined by
$f(x) = x$.  Is this definition correct?  Well, we need to check that for any $n
\in \mathbb{N}$, we have $f(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$.  But by definition, $f(n) = n$,
so we need to check that if $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then also $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Every non-negative integer is certainly an integer, so yes, the definition is
correct.

Now, is this function injective?  For that, let $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$ so that
$f(n) = f(k)$.  We need to prove that $n = k$.  Again, this is easy: $f(n) = n$
and $f(k) = k$, so by putting the three equalities together, we have $n = k$.

We can construct the set $\{f(0), f(1), f(2)\ldots\}$.  If we want to be
precise, we can use the {\it set comprehension} notation:

\[
  \{ f(x) | x \in \mathbb{N} \}
\]

You should read this as ``the set that contains $f(x)$ for each $x \in
\mathbb{N}.$''  That's rather a mouthful, so we'll abbreviate this by
$f(\mathbb{N})$.  Just imagine that instead of applying $f$ to one value in
$\mathbb{N}$, you're applying it to all the values and looking at the results as
a set.

We can now ask ourselves: how big is $f(\mathbb{N})$?  In this case, we can see
that $\mathbb{N} = f(\mathbb{N})$, so of course they're exactly the same size.
However, what if instead of the $f$ we chose, we had chosen $f(x) = -x$, or $g :
\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $g(x) = \frac{1}{1+x}$?  Prove that both
of these are injective functions, and imagine $f(\mathbb{N})$ and
$g(\mathbb{N})$.  How big are these sets?

It should be clear that given any sets $X$ and $Y$ and any function $f : X \to
Y$, $f(X)$ cannot possibly be bigger than $X$.  For every element $y \in f(X)$,
there is some element $x \in X$ so that $f(x) = y$; that's how we defined $f(X)$
in the first place.

% TODO: rewrite this to require less proof.
On the other hand, if $f$ is injective, $f(X)$ also shouldn't be any smaller
than $X$.  Why?  Well, we can just define a function the other way.  Let $g :
f(X) \to X$, and define $g(f(x)) = x$.  Now we know that $g(f(X))$ is no larger
than $f(X)$.  But $g(f(X)) = \{ g(f(x)) | x \in X \} = \{ x | x \in X \} = X$!
That means, by the argument above, that $f(X)$ is no larger than $X$, just as we
wanted.

The careful reader might notice that the definition of $g$ is fishy.  Does a
function defined this way really work?  The answer is that it does, but only
because we were careful about $f$.  We know that if we have an element $y \in
f(X)$, then there is an element $x \in X$ so that $y = f(x)$.  This means that
$g$ really is defined for all $y \in f(X)$.  That's not all, though.
Additionally, suppose there was also a $z \in X$ so that $y = f(z)$.  Then $g(y)
= g(f(x)) = x$, but also $g(y) = g(f(z)) = z$.  For $g$ to be a function, we
need to prove that $x = z$.  Here is where we need the injectivity of $f$: we
know that since $f(x) = y = f(z)$, that $f(x) = f(z)$, and thus $x = z$.
Therefore, $g$ really is a function, and so our argument holds.

Our intuition thus tells us that however we define size, we should make sure
that for any set $X$ and any injective function $f : X \to Y$, we should have
$X$ and $f(X)$ be of equal size.  As $f(X)$ is just a part of $Y$, this means
that $X$ should also be no bigger than $Y$.  By themselves, all these loose bits
of intuition might not seem very useful, but in the next section we'll use them
to show that a certain approach to define size {\it doesn't} work.  First,
however, some exercises.

\sss{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In an older exercise, you saw there were four functions from $\{0, 1\}$
    to itself.  How many injective functions are there?  What about between
    $\{0, 1, 2\}$ and itself?  What if you have even more elements?
  % Something about seeing an injective function as an embedding.
\end{enumerate}

\s{Subsets}

When people first hear that there are as many integers as natural numbers, their
reaction is often ``Surely that can't be right?  Every natural number is an
integer, and there are some others, too!''

To make this argument formal we should introduce the notion of a subset.  We say
that $X$ is a subset of $Y$ if every element of $X$ is also an element of $Y$.
We denote this by $X \subseteq Y$.  We have, then $\emptyset \subseteq \mathbb{N}
\subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.  We will use $X
\subset Y$ when $X$ is a subset of $Y$, but $X$ and $Y$ are not equal.

% Unfinished.  Show that if we assume X subset Y implies |X| < |Y|, that if f is
% injective then |X| = |f(X)|, and that not |X| < |X|, then we can derive a
% contradiction.

% Exercises: unions, intersections, complements

\s{Cardinalities}

% Recall that injective functions allow us to conclude |X| <= |Y|.  Introduce
% surjections and bijections and argue that if f : X -> Y bijective, then f
% injective, thus |X| = |f(X)|, but also f(X) = Y, thus |X| = |Y|.  State,
% without proof, the Cantor-Shroder-Bernstein theorem, and define properly what
% |X| <= |Y| and |X| = |Y| mean.

% Exercises: show |N| = |Z| = |Q+| (introduce products).  Show |Q+| = |Q|.

\s{The Power Set}

% Define the power set.  Prove that the power set of X is strictly greater than
% X.

% Exercises: Continuum hypothesis.

\s{The Category of Sets}

% Point out the structure of "objects and arrows between objects".  Mention that
% this is called a category, and point out some properties of functions
% (composition (+associativity), existence of identities).  Express bijectivity
% as a categorical notion.

% Exercises: Express injectivity and surjectivity as categorical notions.
