\ch{Sets, unary operators, and binary operators.}

This is a chapter on sets. What is a set, you ask? A set is a bunch of
things. Well, duh, right? With math, when we use a colloquial term, like ``set''
or ``group,'' we {\it usually} mean that the math term is similar in {\it
  concept} to the colloquial term, but we usually attach some strings.

The intuition for sets should hopefully be reasonably obvious. But, in the
interest of establishing a convention, I'll first cover the {\it intuition} (or
motivation) behind set theory in \cref{s: Intuition of a Set}, and then go over
the fine-print stuff in \cref{s: Definition of a Set}.

\s{Intuition of a Set}

This is what math people call ``intuitive set theory.'' Or rather, that's the
phrase we use when describing it to other people. As you will come to learn,
mathematicians are, on average, very pompous and pretentious. For that reason,
when us mathematicians talk about this version of set theory among ourselves, we
use the term ``naïve set theory.''\cite{w-naive-set-theory}

This is a quote from the Wikipedia article on naïve set theory:

\begin{quote}
  A set is a well defined collection of distinct objects. The objects that make
  up a set (also known as the elements or members of a set) can be anything:
  numbers, people, letters of the alphabet, other sets, and so on.
\end{quote}

That's a pretty good definition, right there. You might be asking what exactly
the term {\it well-defined} means. And if so, congratulations! That said, the
term {\it well-defined} isn't really well-defined.

Now it turns out that this notion of a set doesn't exactly work out, which is
why we have actual set theory, which I'll go over in \cref{ch: Definition of a
  Set}. But, for the time being, let's roll with this. 

\pg{Notation}

Here's how I'm going to distinguish ``set'' vs ``not a set:''

\begin{enumerate}
\item $0$ is not a set, it is instead the number $0$.
\item $468$ is not a set, it is instead the number $468$.
\item $\{0\}$ is a set, containing only the number $0$.
\item $\{468\}$ is a set, containing only the number $468$.
\item $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ is a set, containing the numbers from $0$ to $9$.
\item $\{299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306\}$ is a set, containing the numbers
  from $299$ to $306$.
\end{enumerate}

You can also have sets of sets, and even combine those sets together to get new
sets.

\newcommand{\sfse}{\{468\}}     %sfse = set four six eight
\newcommand{\sztn}{\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}} %sztn = set zero through nine

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  $\{ \{468\}, \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}, \{299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306\} \}$
  is a meta-set (a set of sets), containing the three aforementioned sets, in
  order.
% Someone put a Civil war joke here, I can't think of one. Maybe something
% about marriage being a magma?
\item $\{468\} \cup \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ is the ``union'' of $\sfse$ and
  $\sztn$. You can think of the union as ``smushing the two sets together to get
  a new set.'' This union comes out to be $\{468, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.
\item $\nil$ is a set, but doesn't have anything in it.
\end{enumerate}

\sss{Exercises}

The solutions are on the next page.

\pg{Unions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make up some arbitrary set, and we'll call it $A$. $A$ can be any
  set. Explain why $A \cup \nil$ always turns out to be $A$, no matter what
  $A$ actually is.
\item Do the same thing as in the previous problem --- but --- this time,
  explain why $\nil \cup A$ always turns out to be $A$, no matter what $A$
  is. Note the difference between $\nil \cup A$ and $A \cup \nil$.
\item Examine your reasoning from the last two problems. Does your reasoning
  that $A \cup A$ is always $A$? Why or why not?
\item Does this mean that $A \cup A$ is always $A$? Why or why not?
\item Does this mean that $\nil \cup \nil$ is always $A$? Why or why not?
