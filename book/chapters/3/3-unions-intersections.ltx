\s{Unions and Intersections}

So, we've talked briefly about sets. We're going to talk more about them a
little bit, then move on to a very special set.

First, some notation. For now, we are going to denote ``the set of sets'' as
$\Set$. That is, for any set $A$, $A \in \Set$ is \truenm. It's also true that
$\Set \in \Set$, which is pretty weird, but we'll get to that later.

First, there's a trivial set, called $\nil$, which is just a set with no
elements. It's obviously true that

\begin{displaymath}
  \nil \subeq A \sfall A \in \Set
\end{displaymath}

We're going to define two operations here:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \cup : \Set \to \Set \to \Set \\
  \cap : \Set \to \Set \to \Set \\
\end{alignedmath}

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{$\nil \Qin \nil$}
  \Answer{No, because $\nil$ does not have any elements. To be even more
    general, there is no $x$ such that $x \in \nil$. Therefore,
    $\nil \notin \nil$.}

  \Exercise{$\nil \Qsubof A \sfall A \in \Set$}
  \Answer{No, because $\nil \notsubof \nil$, and $\nil \in \Set$.}
\end{ExcList}
